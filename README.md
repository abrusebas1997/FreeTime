Activintine is a website application for users to find activities to do in this Quarantine or whenever they have free time. It has video games, music, recommendations for movies, workout videos, etc.

### Basic Site Walk-through

New users need to sign up for an account. Once a user is logged in they are going to be able to choose one of the activities they would like to do. If the user don't know what activity to choose, they can click on the circle for a random activity(still trying to fix). For now just the food recipes and movies section are working.

### Features

* Account creation
* Post creation with image upload(in the food recipes section)
